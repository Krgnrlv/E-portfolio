        <h2>Reflaction on first two week</h2>
        <p>First two weeks of studding math were not as exciting as I expected. Firstly, we were taught about numbers and 
          some simple equations, which we learn in middle school, and this was a little bit disappointing. However, we 
          started a topic about patterns, which we also were learned at school, but it was more interesting since I never 
          heard about quadratic patterns, still it wasn't so hard. I look forward to learn something new and interesting!</p>

        <h2>Reflection (7.10.24 – 13.10.24)</h2>
        <p>On this week we had our first class text. It wasn’t very hard, but it gave us an idea how tests are look like, what is the prosses of it 
          and what to expect in general. I am quite happy with the results, I had some little problems in formatting and lack of explanation, but I 
          will fix it on our next test. I am very excited about our future topics and tests.</p>
