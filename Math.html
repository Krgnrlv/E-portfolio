        <h2>Reflection on first two week</h2>
        <p>The first two weeks of studying math weren’t as exciting as I had hoped. At first, we focused on numbers and simple equations, topics I 
          had already covered in middle school. It was a bit disappointing to start with material I was already familiar with, as I was expecting more 
          of a challenge. However, things started to get more interesting when we began discussing patterns. We touched on some patterns I had seen 
          before, but there was a new twist — quadratic patterns. I had never encountered this before, and it was intriguing to learn how these patterns 
          work. Even though the concept itself wasn’t too difficult to grasp, it felt refreshing to tackle something new. Overall, I’m excited to move 
          forward and dive into more advanced topics. I’m looking forward to learning new concepts that will challenge me more and spark my curiosity!</p>

        <h2>Reflection (7.10.24 – 13.10.24)</h2>
        <p>This week, we had our first class test, and it was a good introduction to what future tests will be like. The test wasn’t very hard, but 
          it gave us a clear idea of the format, the types of questions, and the overall process of taking a test. It was useful in helping us 
          understand what to expect in future assessments. Personally, I’m quite happy with my results. While I did well, I did encounter a few minor 
          issues, such as some formatting errors and a lack of explanation in a few answers. These are things I can easily improve on for the next 
          test, and I’m already planning how to approach them differently next time. I’m really excited about the upcoming topics and tests; they seem 
          interesting, and I’m looking forward to applying what I’ve learned to perform even better. This test was a great starting point, and I’m 
          ready for the challenges ahead!</p>

        <h2>Reflection (14.10.24 – 24.10.24)</h2>
        <p>This week we took a Math test on geometric sequences, pensions, and investing. It wasn’t hard, but it required careful attention to detail. 
          I made sure to go through each problem methodically, applying the formulas correctly. The concepts, like understanding how geometric 
          sequences relate to pensions and investments, were straightforward once I grasped the main ideas. I’m happy with my performance, scoring 
          85%.I’m pleased with the result. Overall, it was a good test to assess my understanding of these topics, and I feel confident about the material.</p>
