      <h2>Reflection on first two weeks of studying</h2>
      <p>First two weeks of studding math were not as exciting as I expected. Firstly, we were taught about numbers and 
        some simple equations, which we learn in middle school, and this was a little bit disappointing. However, we 
        started a topic about patterns, which we also were learned at school, but it was more interesting since I never 
        heard about quadratic patterns, still it wasn't so hard. I look forward to learn something new and interesting!</p>
