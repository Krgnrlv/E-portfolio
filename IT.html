        <h2>Reflaction on first two weeks of studying</h2>
        <p>The first two weeks of studying programming were a bit disappointing for me. We spent a lot of time going over basics that I already knew, 
          and I was hoping to learn something new. While it was good to reinforce what I had learned, I felt a bit bored. I really want to dive into 
          new topics and work on some fun projects. I understand the need for a strong foundation, but I’m looking forward to more exciting lessons in 
          the coming weeks!</p>

        <h2>Reflection (7.10.24 – 13.10.24)</h2>
        <p>This week, we focused on variables and how we can use them in our code. We learned about different types of variables, like integers, 
          strings, and floats, and how to assign values to them. While I understand the importance of knowing how variables work, I find this topic a 
          bit basic and not as exciting as I had hoped. It was useful to reinforce the concept, but I’m more interested in learning how to build more 
          complex programs and solve problems using coding. I’m looking forward to diving into topics like functions, loops, and eventually working 
          with data structures or algorithms, which I find much more engaging. Coding more practical, real-world projects is also something I’m excited 
          about, as it will allow me to apply the knowledge in a more creative way.</p>
