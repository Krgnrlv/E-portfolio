      <h2>Reflaction on first two weeks of studying</h2>
      <p>The first two weeks of studying programming were a bit disappointing for me. We spent a lot of time going over basics that I 
          already knew, and I was hoping to learn something new. While it was good to reinforce what I had learned, I felt a bit bored. 
          I really want to dive into new topics and work on some fun projects. I understand the need for a strong foundation, but Iâ€™m 
          looking forward to more exciting lessons in the coming weeks!</p>
