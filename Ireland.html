        <h2>Culture night</h2>
        <P>Dublin’s Culture Night is an event that brings people from all over the world together,
          and this year we had a chance to visit it! Me and my friends saw an amazing show of Brazilian music and choir that stole the spotlight!</p>
        <p>Firstly, when we came to Dublin, we went to the Powerscourt Townhouse Centre where choir was singing popular songs but in a new way. 
          Their show was mesmerising and we couldn't leave until we had listened to all the songs.</p>
        <p>Then we were walking along a Dame street when we saw a Brazilian live music event with a lively samba group that had everyone clapping along. 
          Everyone was singing, dancing and just had an amazing time. It felt like we were transported straight to Brazil!</p>
        <p>One of the best parts of Culture Night is how it brings people together. It makes folks from all over the world sharing laughs 
          and stories about their own cultures.</p>
        <p>As the night ended up, we left with a huge smile and full of joy. 
          The Brazilian and choir show was a reminder of how powerful music can be in connecting us all. Can’t wait for next year’s Culture Night!</p>

          <h2>Portmarnock Beach</h2>
          <p>On our first weekends me and my friends decided to go to the beach and see some cinematic views of sea.</p>
          <p>Weather wasn’t as good as we expected, but it wasn’t something that could stop us. Our trip started with an 
            hour-long bus ride, however look of some houses, which were really nice and cozy, took all our attention, 
            so we didn’t notice how we already arrived to the Portmarnock beach.</p>
          <p>First thing we were shocked about is that despite weather conditions and cold weather there were group of 
            people, who were swimming! Unfortunately, we weren’t so brave to try it ourself. Instead, 
            we took lots of photos of sea and collected some shells as a reminder about this trip. When we took a 
            long walk along the sea side and came back home.</p>
          <p>On this trip we weren’t do anything very active, but it was very cozy and relaxing as well as made us closer to nature. 
            I believe that this weekend were first steps towards knowing Ireland. </p>

          <h2>Powerscourt Waterfall and Powerscourt House Garden</h2>
          <p>Powerscourt Waterfall and Powerscourt House Garden is one of the most beautiful travel attraction. One to never forgotten thanks to the sunny 
            weather and the surrounding beauty. In terms of beauty the waterfall was one of the highest in Ireland, falling from a strong rocks, which are 
            surrounded by prominent several trees. Around the falls there was no noise, only the sound of the water which made the scene even more impressive. 
            We had so much fun, staying here for a while, capturing the scenery from different points.</p>
          <p>The gardens that are positioned around Powerscourt Manor were also very beautiful. There were paths diluted with flowers, green hedges, 
            green trees the causes very colorful hues all the way. We have walked through the Japanese Garden with smaller pools, the garden consisted 
            of unusual plants, rose beds that designed in specific ways. Every portion of the garden was stunning- we, therefore, clicked numerous pictures 
            in every place. Before the day ended, we had countless snapshots taken and wonderful memories created from that beautiful tranquil place.</p>

          <h2>Howth</h2>
          <p>We visited Howth twice, and both days were memorable in their own way. On the first day, the weather was rainy, but that didn’t stop us 
            from exploring. As we walked along the harbor, we spotted a seal swimming near the shore, which made the chilly, wet weather worthwhile. 
            The next day, the weather improved dramatically. It was sunny and warm, perfect for a short hike. We took a scenic trail along the cliffs, 
            enjoying breathtaking views of the coastline and the ocean. The hike was peaceful, with the sun shining brightly and the breeze refreshing. 
            It was a wonderful way to experience the beauty of Howth, from the seal sighting to the stunning vistas on our hike. Both days offered 
            something special, making our trip unforgettable.</p>

          <h2>Halloween</h2>
          <p>Halloween in Dublin was a memorable experience for me and my friend! On the 31st of October, we worked as animators for kids, and it was 
            so much fun. We got to dress up and engage with the kids, helping them with games and activities — it was such a rewarding and lively 
            atmosphere. After our shift, we headed to the city center to catch the Halloween parade, which we were really excited about. However, 
            when we got there, we found out that the parade was actually a fake event, which was a bit disappointing. Despite that, we made the most 
            of the evening by walking around the city. Dublin looked fantastic with all the Halloween decorations, and there was a fun, spooky atmosphere in 
            the air. We explored the streets, grabbed some food, and just enjoyed the lively atmosphere. It turned out to be a great night, even 
            without the parade!</p>
