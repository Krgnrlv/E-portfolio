      <h2>Culture night</h2>
      <P>Dublin’s Culture Night is an event that brings people from all over the world together,
         and this year we had a chance to visit it! Me and my friends saw an amazing show of Brazilian music and choir that stole the spotlight!</p>
      <p>Firstly, when we came to Dublin, we went to the Powerscourt Townhouse Centre where choir was singing popular songs but in a new way. 
        Their show was mesmerising and we couldn't leave until we had listened to all the songs.</p>
      <p>Then we were walking along a Dame street when we saw a Brazilian live music event with a lively samba group that had everyone clapping along. 
        Everyone was singing, dancing and just had an amazing time. It felt like we were transported straight to Brazil!</p>
      <p>One of the best parts of Culture Night is how it brings people together. It makes folks from all over the world sharing laughs 
        and stories about their own cultures.</p>
      <p>As the night ended up, we left with a huge smile and full of joy. 
        The Brazilian and choir show was a reminder of how powerful music can be in connecting us all. Can’t wait for next year’s Culture Night!</p>

        <h2>Portmarnock Beach</h2>
        <p>On our first weekends me and my friends decided to go to the beach and see some cinematic views of sea.</p>
        <p>Weather wasn’t as good as we expected, but it wasn’t something that could stop us. Our trip started with an 
          hour-long bus ride, however look of some houses, which were really nice and cozy, took all our attention, 
          so we didn’t notice how we already arrived to the Portmarnock beach.</p>
        <p>First thing we were shocked about is that despite weather conditions and cold weather there were group of 
          people, who were swimming! Unfortunately, we weren’t so brave to try it ourself. Instead, 
          we took lots of photos of sea and collected some shells as a reminder about this trip. When we took a 
          long walk along the sea side and came back home.</p>
        <p>On this trip we weren’t do anything very active, but it was very cozy and relaxing as well as made us closer to nature. 
          I believe that this weekend were first steps towards knowing Ireland. </p>
