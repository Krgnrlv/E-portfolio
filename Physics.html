      <h2>Reflection on first two weeks of studying</h2>
      <p>On first two weeks of studying physics, we didn't learn much. We were revising how to convert one quantitiy 
        to another and what are significant numbers. I know that program made to bring all of us on the same level, but for 
        me it was very easy and I probably want to learn something new rather then recall some basics from school. I hope that 
        this is just a begining towards some interesting and new information.</p>
