        <h2>Reflaction on first two week</h2>
        <p>The first two weeks of studying physics didn’t feel very challenging for me. We spent most of our time revising basic concepts, like 
          converting one quantity to another and understanding significant figures. These are topics I already learned in school, so they didn’t feel 
          particularly engaging or difficult. I understand that the program is designed to bring everyone up to the same level of understanding, which 
          makes sense for those who may need a refresher. However, for me, it felt more like a review of things I already knew, which didn’t spark much 
          excitement. I’m really hoping that now that we’ve covered the basics, we can move on to more interesting and complex topics like motion, energy, 
          or electricity. I’m eager to dive into concepts that will challenge me and deepen my understanding of how the physical world works. I’m hopeful 
          that these first weeks are just the beginning and that we’ll soon get into more advanced and exciting material.</p>

        <h2>Reflection (7.10.24 – 13.10.24)</h2>
        <p>This week, we focused on acceleration and velocity, which was both helpful and interesting for me. I wasn’t able to study physics very 
          thoroughly in school, so I’m really glad that we’re starting from the basics and building up my understanding step by step. Learning how 
          velocity and acceleration relate to motion has been eye-opening, especially since these concepts are fundamental to so many aspects of 
          physics. It feels good to finally grasp how objects move and how to calculate things like speed and changes in velocity. I'm looking forward 
          to diving into more interesting topics as the year progresses, especially as we move into more complex areas of physics. I’m excited to 
          continue building on this foundation and understanding how everything works in the physical world around us!</p>
