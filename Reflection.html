          <h2>Introduction week (16.09.24)</h2>
          <p>The introduction week at MIE was a mix of excitement and useful information. We were given a clear idea 
              of what to expect as students and how to navigate our new responsibilities. They talked a lot about how 
              we’re becoming adults now and what that means—basically managing our own time and studies. We also got an 
              overview of what we’ll be taught and how to balance classes with student life. It felt a bit overwhelming 
              at times, but overall, it was a good way to start feeling like a college student. Teachers in Russia and 
              Ireland both care deeply about education, but they have different experiences. Back in Russia, teachers 
              often would work with larger classes and follow a strict curriculum focused on academic success. However 
              here, in Ireland, teachers enjoy a more flexible curriculum that encourages creativity and critical thinking. 
              We work in smaller classes and focus on a more holistic approach to learning. I think that method that Irish 
              teachers use here is better for students, since it is not only about grades, it’s about our personal opinions 
              and interest. Because of that, I look forward to studying here this year and experience new way of learning 
              on myself!</p>
