      <h2>Introduction week</h2>
      <p>The introduction week at Trinity College was a mix of excitement and useful information. We were given a clear idea of what to expect as 
          students and how to navigate our new responsibilities. They talked a lot about how we’re becoming adults now and what that means—basically 
          managing our own time and studies. We also got an overview of what we’ll be taught and how to balance classes with student life. It felt a 
          bit overwhelming at times, 
          but overall, it was a good way to start feeling like a college student. I’m looking forward to what's next!</p>
