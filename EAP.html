          <h2>Reflection on introduction week (16.09.2024)</h2>
          <p>The introduction week at MIE was a mix of excitement and useful information. We were given a clear idea 
              of what to expect as students and how to navigate our new responsibilities. They talked a lot about how 
              we’re becoming adults now and what that means—basically managing our own time and studies. We also got an 
              overview of what we’ll be taught and how to balance classes with student life. It felt a bit overwhelming 
              at times, but overall, it was a good way to start feeling like a college student. Teachers in Russia and 
              Ireland both care deeply about education, but they have different experiences. Back in Russia, teachers 
              often would work with larger classes and follow a strict curriculum focused on academic success. However 
              here, in Ireland, teachers enjoy a more flexible curriculum that encourages creativity and critical thinking. 
              We work in smaller classes and focus on a more holistic approach to learning. I think that method that Irish 
              teachers use here is better for students, since it is not only about grades, it’s about our personal opinions 
              and interest. Because of that, I look forward to studying here this year and experience new way of learning 
              on myself!</p>

        <h2>How college degree will affect on my life now and in the future? (23.09.2024)</h2>
        <p>In my opinion university has a very big impact on life and career of every person. 
          It could give as skills, that might be helpful in getting a dream-job and be the best in your workplace, 
          as skills which would be useful in life. Personally, I think that the best things that college is providing
          is deeper knowledge in your sphere, also it teaches you how to be calm as well as don't be stressed every time. 
          It teaches how to be independent, how to be an adult.</p>
        <p>However, university is not only about learning, it is also about having fun and making new friends from 
          all over the world. Things which I want to have after I finish college are: have a lot of new meetings which 
          will be helpful in my future career, of course deeper knowledge in computer science, because with better 
          skills better salary comes and lots of fun memories about this time.</p>
        <p>College is a place where everybody is new, 
          everyone is trying their best and we have to take everything we can from this time.</p>

        <h2>What are pros and cons of buying food from local farmers? (30.09.2024)</h2>
        <p>Nowadays good quality vegetables and fruits are very rare in shops or not there at all. 
          So maybe we should start buy them directly from local farmers? Let’s find out.</p>
        <p>Well, as many questions this one hasn’t got a right answer. One people prefer to buy vegetables is shops, 
          because they can be sure that they will have only what is needed and they don’t have to worry that they won’t 
          get groceries due to bed weather conditions on a farm. Others believe that even though its cost is higher they
          will buy their food only from local farmers, since they will support local economy and they can be sure about 
          quality of their groceries.</p>
        <p>Personally, I think this idea is really good because it’s not only providing people with fresh products without 
          toxic chemicals, but also very helpful for environment due to reducing packaging. However, I can understand 
          why others don’t buy their food from farmers: its cost, lack of variety and inconvenience.</p>
        <p>To sum up, I believe that with every year amount of people, who buying groceries from farmers, 
          will increase and this is our goal to make people provided with a good quality food and help our environment. </p>

        <h2>Folk project №1 (7.10.2024)</h2>
        <h3>Analysis of Inuits tale</h3>
        <p>In all times folks from all over the world wrote stories, songs, adage and so on. In those previous generations told to their descendants 
          about their live experience, their culture and life guidelines.</p>
        <p>Inuits wore one of those folks. One of their most popular story told us about a woman, which was drowned by her own father. Than man catches 
          her skeleton out of the sea. Firstly, he was deadly scared, but then understand that skeleton doesn't deserve this attitude and tucked It in 
          his coat, like it was alive. After that, man falls asleep and starts crying. Skeleton saw that and acknowledge that this man had pure and kind 
          soul. Skeleton took piece of It and turned into beautiful woman, bringing happiness and peace to a man.</p>
        <p>This story could be analyzed differently. Some people think that it's about attitude towards death, others see some hidden symbols and believe 
          that this story is a representation of relationships development. We believe that this tale is about love. Womans skeleton was “waiting” for 
          man to catch her and then attached to him. Than man gave her his  “warm” and home, skeleton bloom to a gorgeous woman and gave him her love 
          back. Main meaning is that we ned to help others under any circumstances.</p>
        <p>Moreover, in this story we can see a lot of problems in human existence like father, who drowned his daughter, or loneliness of a man.</p>
        <p>  Also, we can find morals and specific values in the tale. The significant one is good attitude to human, no matter dead or alive. Give chances to people even if they don’t 
          look good or everyone consider him as a bad person.</p>
        <p> From this legend we learn a lot about culture and traditions of inuits. For example, where and how they were living, what food they ate, 
          what were they wearing and so on. We can see that main way of providing with food was fishing. It is clearly that they were living in an Arctic 
          due to warm clothes of a man, which were made out of wool. Just from this small details we can imagine what they culture was like.</p>
        <p>Folklore is a huge part of any culture through it you can easily get key points of traditions and life of previous generations we can learn a lot of new from it, 
          that is why we can't forgot about folklore of our own nationals and need to being it further through generation.</p>

        <h2>Folk project №2 (14.10.2024)</h2>
        <h3>Tir na nÓg in six dimensions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li class="h3">Individualism vs. Collectivism (IDV):</li>
          <p>The Tir na nÓg tale leans towards collectivism, as it emphasizes bonds within a community and the importance of family. Oisín’s insistence 
            on going back to his homeland even after all those years away can be tied to his loyalty to his family and his people. This may also show us 
            that Oisín’s culture is one that values the community over individual pursuits. </p>
          <li class="h3">Indulgence vs. Restraint (IVR):</li>
          <p>The culture portrayed in the tale Tir na nÓg contains elements of indulgence, especially in the descriptions of the faerie realm. 
              In this story, the setting of Tir na nÓg is a paradise-like place where one can find a lot of joy and happiness, indulge in pleasures, 
              and satisfy all needs. In the story, the author briefly mentions that Oisín has spent hundreds of years in Tir na nÓg, conveying that 
              indulgence and pleasure can make time pass by particularly quickly because the brain is already immersed in numb happiness. Excessive 
              indulgence can make people lack the ability to think independently and do things they normally wouldn’t do. When Oisín returns to Ireland, 
              everything familiar to him no longer exists, and three hundred years have disappeared in the blink of an eye in his pleasure.</p> 
          <li class="h3">Uncertainty Avoidance Index (UAI):</li>
          <p>The story of Tir na nÓg shows a culture with low uncertainty avoidance, as Oisín willingly embarks on the journey to a unknown and 
            mysterious realm without fully knowing the consequences of this action. His acceptance of Niamh’s invitation despite the risks it 
            presents, reflects a culture that values exploration and is open to uncertainties in life. Oisín’s adventurous spirit represents a 
            community that embraces these uncertainties as opportunities for growth and experience.</p>
          <li class="h3">Masculinity vs. Femininity (MAS):</li>
          <p>There are very obvious female characteristics in this story, such as a beautiful white horse and a beautiful princess in the land of 
            youth. However, women are always limited in this story, and the image of the princess is only beautiful. The princess in the land of 
            youth is just a princess, but Oisín appears as a great hero in the story. In comparison, the princess is given less power and energy, 
            and she tried to prevent Oisín from returning to Ireland but was unsuccessful. This represents that she does not have a high voice in the 
            family and has tolerated many concessions.</p>

          <h2>Language for comparison and contrast (28.10.2024)</h2>
          <h3>Studying at a Local College</h3>
          <p>Local colleges usually have low tuition fees and living costs which makes quality education affordable. Students can reside with their 
            family which saves them even more money. Local colleges are more convenient as well because students are more likely to get personalized 
            attention . In addition, these colleges are more flexible with their working hours which helps students with employment or family matters. 
            Nevertheless, local colleges may not have features such as a wide variety of courses, opportunities for research and little to no industry 
            connections. They may also have a limited social life and few extracurricular activities as well. Even though local colleges have a relaxing 
            atmosphere and cost-effective tuition, students with the ambition to get specialized programs or industry connections will come across 
            several challenges.</p>
          <h3>Studying at a University in the Capital City</h3>
          <p>A university in the capital city offers top-quality education, better facilities, and strong industry connections. Students have access 
            to expert professors, specialized programs, and a diverse academic environment. There are more networking events, internships, and career 
            opportunities, increasing employment prospects. However, living costs, tuition fees, and daily expenses are significantly higher. Students 
            often need to adapt to a fast-paced, competitive atmosphere. While social life is vibrant, with numerous extracurricular activities, large 
            class sizes may mean less individual attention from professors. Despite the challenges, studying in the capital can be an exciting and 
            rewarding experience, preparing students for global career opportunities.</p>

          <h2>Reflect on peer-review process (04.11.2024)</h2>
          <p>Participating in the peer-review process using the Ladder of Feedback model was a helpful and new experience for me as an international 
            student. Before the process, I felt a little nervous because I was unsure how my classmates would view my work. I also worried about 
            whether my feedback for others would be useful. However, I was also excited to get comments to improve my draft.</p>
          <p>During the process, I felt more comfortable because the Ladder of Feedback had a clear structure. It started with asking questions, then 
            moved to positive comments, and finally gave space for suggestions and concerns. This made the feedback feel respectful and helpful. I 
            enjoyed reading my peer’s work because it helped me think critically about writing. When I received feedback, it was encouraging to hear 
            about my strengths, but the suggestions for improvement were the most valuable.</p>
          <p>After the session, I felt more confident about revising my draft. I used the feedback to make unclear parts more detailed and to improve 
            the flow of ideas. Overall, the process was better than I expected. Next time, I will prepare better questions about my work and take more 
            notes during the discussion. This experience helped me both as a writer and a reviewer.</p>

        <h2>Folk project №3 (21.10.2024)</h2>
        <h3>Comprising of «Tír na nÓg» and «Urashima Taro» tales.</h3>
        <p>In both the «Tír na nÓg» and «Urashima Taro» tales we can see that there are themes of time, immortality, and the consequences of 
          acting without thinking of the outcome.</p>
          <p>One of the similarities of these two tales is a general story concept. Both tales have a main character who spends more time than they 
            intended in another realm, only to find that everything they once knew is now gone. In both stories the main characters are tempted by 
            the promise of a paradise or reward, but in both stories, this comes at a cost. In «Tír na nÓg», returning to his homeland causes Óisín’s 
            death; in «Urashima Taro», opening the box causes Taro to age rapidly and as a result of this: his death.</p>
            <p>Another similarity of «Tír na nÓg» and «Urashima Taro» tales is symbolism. The paradise described in «Tír na nÓg» and the Dragon Palace 
              in «Urashima Taro» are both realms that symbolize a place beyond human understanding, where time passes differently, and human desires 
              are fulfilled. Both places highlight the temptation of the unknown and the dangers it may hold. In both tales, the act of returning to 
              home comes with a confrontation of reality and mortality. Both Óisín and Taro had to face the fact that their families were now gone and 
              the land they once lived in was unrecognizable to them.</p>
            <p>While «Tír na nÓg» and «Urashima Taro» share common themes of time and consequence, they are shaped by their distinct cultural contexts. In 
              first story Óisín didn’t thought about his family and friends a lot when he decided to go to the magic land. That can show us that Irish 
              society of that time was more individualistic. However, in second story Taro was about to reject invitation to go to the Sea Palace, because of 
              his sick and old mother, but then he still agrees, because he thought it wouldn't be for a long time. It tells us about more collectivistic 
              society in Japan. Also, this story clearly expresses the role of nature in human life, which we couldn’t see in «Tír na nÓg».</p>
            <p>Both stories emphasize the passage of time and the nature of mortality. In the magical lands, the heroes live in pleasure, but upon returning 
              to the mortal world, they face the harsh reality of time catching up.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, it is always very interesting how, it would seem, completely different in their culture nations have common moral principles 
                and values and even come up with very similar plots. Of course, each story has its own unique features by which we can say about society of 
                each individual folk. Therefore, it is important to get acquainted with tales and learn more about your own and other nations through them.</p>

        <h2>Review of Folk project (04.11.2024)</h2>
        <p>While I was doing our folk project, I realized that folktales are a fascinating way to learn about different cultures. It was even more 
          interesting for someone like me who is now experiencing traditions from the outside. I noticed that folktales bring culture to life in a 
          way that feels natural and easy to understand, even without a detailed explanation. Through the characters, conflicts, and values presented 
          in these stories, I understood what each society values and how people from that culture think about things like family, respect, or courage. 
          As an example, in the Irish tale of Tír na nÓg, Oisín travels to the mystical land of youth, this story emphasizes values like bravery, love, 
          and the charm of adventure.</p> 
        <p>One of the insights I learned from this project is how similar some folktales are, even from cultures on opposite sides of the world. Themes 
          like the journey of life, love, or explanation of the origin of geographical objects are present in many folktales, showing the connection we 
          all share through similar life experiences. This universality of certain ideas and values surprised me because I used to think of each culture 
          as very distinct, but now, I feel like these shared stories can help bring people closer together, creating understanding across 
          cultural divides.</p>
        <p>As for the Hofstede culture matrix, it is helpful as a general tool but somewhat limiting. It breaks down cultural values into categories 
          like individualism vs. collectivism and power distance, which helped me understand certain patterns, but it doesn’t capture the full complexity 
          that I noticed in the folktales. Folktales often reveal a lot of mixed values and contradictions within a culture, showing that culture is not 
          always consistent or straightforward.</p> 
        <p>Personally, this project has changed the way I see cultural differences. I feel more respectful and curious about the unique values behind 
          certain traditions and beliefs, also this experience will make me more open-minded when meeting people from other cultures in the future, recognizing 
          that everyone background is shaped by these deep-rooted stories. It’s also encouraged me to look for similarities with others rather than only 
          focusing on differences, seeing how our shared narratives can bring us together.</p>

          <h2>Reflect on my first class test in EAP (10.11.24)</h2>
          <p>On my first EAP class test, I did well, scoring 20.5 out of 24. I think, it is a good result for the firs text. It was divided into two 
            parts: using words from the Academic Wordlist and checking how reliable a text is. For first part I prepared by checking the wordlist, 
            most of words I knew, but with those I didn’t know or wasn’t so sure with I was checking for their definitions and practicing how to use 
            them in sentences. For second part I was practicing by finding if my annotated bibliography was reliable. This preparation helped me, 
            especially with the first task, where I felt confident and used academic words.</p>
          <p>The second task, about judging the reliability of a text, was not too hard for me. I felt that my preparation gave me a good understanding 
            of what to look for, and I was able to apply it during the test. However, I think I could still improve by practicing with a wider range of 
            examples to feel even more confident.</p>
          <p>The test was mostly what I expected, but I didn’t plan my time well enough for the second task. For the next test, I will try to divide my 
            time more accurate. I will also continue to practice using academic words in harder examples to improve my writing. These things will help 
            me do even better on next test.</p>

          <h2>Reflection on annual examination (27.01.2025)</h2>
          <p>Reviewing my exam prep and performance allows me to understand how I can further improve. As I have looked over my study schedule, I came 
            across a realistic restriction that I had developed. Certain subjects were left with significantly more focus than others, and some topics 
            within subjects were highly glossed over. For the future, I will focus on more effective time management so that I can cover each topic 
            sufficiently. Retrospectively predicting exam topics proved to have mixed results - I was accurate in some areas, yet missed a fair amount 
            of concepts. I will aim to broaden my scope for revision in the future.</p>
          <p>On the exam day, I made sure to skim the paper before attempting it. This gave me a rough idea of the questions and how many marks each 
            question would provide me. In this instance, I failed to devise a plan as to which questions needed to be answered first. Although I did 
            identify the easier questions, I found myself spending an inappropriate amount of time on those, causing me to rush when answering the 
            higher value and more challenging questions. My time management strategy needs adaptation. I will make an effort to remember allocating 
            time based participants’ needs, focusing mainly on the more scoring questions first while ensuring that time will be available to attempt 
            all questions.</p>
          <p>I felt a combination of anxiety and confidence at the same time. Questions that needed memorization were fairly easy, however essay questions 
            were extremely difficult. During uncertain times, I would not trust myself which led to further procrastination. Practicing more under these 
            conditions would enable me to instill a sense of confidence and effectiveness for time constrained situations. </p>
          <p>For my future exams, I will attempt to balance all topics within all my study sessions, use more practice tests in order to anticipate the 
            types of questions that can be posed, learn how to manage my time appropriately, and focus on remaining calm during the test. This insight 
            revealed the need to be strict with revision schedules, develop an improved questioning strategy, along with reinforced self-belief to be 
            helpful in future interactions.</p>
