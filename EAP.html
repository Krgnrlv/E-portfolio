        <h2>How college degree will affect on my life now and in the future?</h2>
        <p>In my opinion university has a very big impact on life and career of every person. 
          It could give as skills, that might be helpful in getting a dream-job and be the best in your workplace, 
          as skills which would be useful in life. Personally, I think that the best things that college is providing
          is deeper knowledge in your sphere, also it teaches you how to be calm as well as don't be stressed every time. 
          It teaches how to be independent, how to be an adult.</p>
        <p>However, university is not only about learning, it is also about having fun and making new friends from 
          all over the world. Things which I want to have after I finish college are: have a lot of new meetings which 
          will be helpful in my future career, of course deeper knowledge in computer science, because with better 
          skills better salary comes and lots of fun memories about this time.</p>
        <p>College is a place where everybody is new, 
          everyone is trying their best and we have to take everything we can from this time.</p>

        <h2>What are pros and cons of buying food from local farmers?</h2>
        <p>Nowadays good quality vegetables and fruits are very rare in shops or not there at all. 
          So maybe we should start buy them directly from local farmers? Let’s find out.</p>
        <p>Well, as many questions this one hasn’t got a right answer. One people prefer to buy vegetables is shops, 
          because they can be sure that they will have only what is needed and they don’t have to worry that they won’t 
          get groceries due to bed weather conditions on a farm. Others believe that even though its cost is higher they
          will buy their food only from local farmers, since they will support local economy and they can be sure about 
          quality of their groceries.</p>
        <p>Personally, I think this idea is really good because it’s not only providing people with fresh products without 
          toxic chemicals, but also very helpful for environment due to reducing packaging. However, I can understand 
          why others don’t buy their food from farmers: its cost, lack of variety and inconvenience.</p>
        <p>To sum up, I believe that with every year amount of people, who buying groceries from farmers, 
          will increase and this is our goal to make people provided with a good quality food and help our environment. </p>

        <h2>Folk project №1 (7.10.2024)</h2>
        <p>In all times folks from all over the world wrote stories, songs, adage and so on. In those previous generations told to their descendants 
          about their live expirence, their culture and life guidelines.</p>
        <p>Inuits wore one of those folks. One of their most popular story told us about a woman, which was drowned by her own father. Than man catches 
          her skeleton out of the sea. Firstly, he was deadly scared, but then understand that skeleton doesn't deserve this attitude and tucked It in 
          his cout, like it was alive. After that, man falls asleep and starts crying. Skeleton saw that and acknowlege that this man had pure and kind 
          soul. Skeleton took piece of It and turned into beautiful woman, bringing happiness and peace to a man.</p>
        <p>This story could be analized differently. Some people think that it's about attitude twards death, others see some hidden symbols and belive 
          that this story is a representation of relationships development. We belive that this tale is about love. Womans skeleron was “waiting” for 
          man to catch her and then attached to him. Than man gave her his  “warm” and home, skeleton bloom to a gorgeous woman and gave him her love 
          back. Main meaning is that we ned to help others under any crcumstances.</p>
        <p>Moreover, in this story we can see a lot of problems in human existence like father, who drawned his daughter, or loneliness of a man.</p>
        <p>  Also, we can find morals and specific values in the tale. The sigmificant one is good attitude to human, no matter dead or alive. Give chances to people even if they don’t 
          look good or everyone considere him as a bad person.</p>
        <p> From this legend we learn a lot about culture and traditions of inuits. For example, where and how they were living, what food they ate, 
          what were they wearing and so on. We can see that main way of providing with food was fishing. It is clearly that they were living in an Arctic 
          due to warm clothes of a man, which were made out of wool. Just from this small details we can imagen what they culture was like.</p>
        <p>Folklore is a huge part of any culture through it you can easily get key points of traditions and life of previous generations we can learn a lot of new from it, 
          that is why we can't forgot about folklore of our own nationals and need to being it further through generation.</p>
