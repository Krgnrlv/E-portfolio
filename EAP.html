      <h2>How college degree will affect on my life now and in the future?</h2>
      <p>In my opinion university has a very big impact on life and career of every person. 
        It could give as skills, that might be helpful in getting a dream-job and be the best in your workplace, 
        as skills which would be useful in life. Personally, I think that the best things that college is providing
         is deeper knowledge in your sphere, also it teaches you how to be calm as well as don't be stressed every time. 
         It teaches how to be independent, how to be an adult.</p>
      <p>However, university is not only about learning, it is also about having fun and making new friends from 
        all over the world. Things which I want to have after I finish college are: have a lot of new meetings which 
        will be helpful in my future career, of course deeper knowledge in computer science, because with better 
        skills better salary comes and lots of fun memories about this time.</p>
      <p>College is a place where everybody is new, 
        everyone is trying their best and we have to take everything we can from this time.</p>

      <h2>What are pros and cons of buying food from local farmers?</h2>
      <p>Nowadays good quality vegetables and fruits are very rare in shops or not there at all. 
        So maybe we should start buy them directly from local farmers? Let’s find out.</p>
      <p>Well, as many questions this one hasn’t got a right answer. One people prefer to buy vegetables is shops, 
        because they can be sure that they will have only what is needed and they don’t have to worry that they won’t 
        get groceries due to bed weather conditions on a farm. Others believe that even though its cost is higher they
        will buy their food only from local farmers, since they will support local economy and they can be sure about 
        quality of their groceries.</p>
      <p>Personally, I think this idea is really good because it’s not only providing people with fresh products without 
        toxic chemicals, but also very helpful for environment due to reducing packaging. However, I can understand 
        why others don’t buy their food from farmers: its cost, lack of variety and inconvenience.</p>
      <p>To sum up, I believe that with every year amount of people, who buying groceries from farmers, 
        will increase and this is our goal to make people provided with a good quality food and help our environment. </p>
